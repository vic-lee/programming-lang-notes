Recall the 3 things we want from a PL:

1. unambiguity
2. turing complete (can compute any problem)


Desirable properties:

1. readability
2. conciseness
3. safety (`outOfBounds` in Java vs `undefined` in c)
4. mathematical foundations
5. ...

```java
System.out.println("42");
// 42 is the dynamic semantics
```
